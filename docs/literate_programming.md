# Literate Programming

Notes from [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)

> Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a computer program is given an explanation of its logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which compilable source code can be generated.

This aligns very well with sspec goals. A technical specification is primarily text in a natural language like English interspersed with programmatic sections.

The structure of the program is explained for better understanding by other humans rather than an order imposed by the programming language.

As an example consider a markdown file with code snippets that can be executed.

Some implementations are-
* [Emacs org mode with babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html)
* [Literate](https://zyedidia.github.io/literate/index.html)
* [Jupyter notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter)
